## Development

### pre-commit hooks

pre-commit is a tool that checks and fixes simple issues (formatting, ...) before each commit. You can install it by following [their website](https://pre-commit.com/). In order to enable checks for this repo run `pre-commit install` from command-line in the root of this repo.

The checks are also performed in the CI to ensure the code follows consistent formatting.
